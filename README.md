# Python Learnings

This repository documents my journey of learning Python through the "Complete 2025 Python Bootcamp Learn Python from Scratch by Code With Harry". It includes code snippets, exercises, and projects covering a wide range of Python concepts, from the basics to advanced topics.

## Core Concepts

* **Setup and Syntax**: Basic setup and Python syntax.
* **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding variables and various data types in Python.
* **Typecasting**: Converting between different data types.
* **User Input**: Taking input from the user.
* **Comments, Print, and Escape Sequences**: Writing comments, using the `print` function, and understanding escape sequences.
* **Operators**: Arithmetic, conditional, logical, and assignment operators.
* **Conditionals**: `if`, `else`, `elif`, and `match` statements.
* **Loops**: `for` and `while` loops, `break`, `continue`, and `pass` statements.
* **Strings**: String creation, indexing, slicing, and methods.
* **Functions**: Defining functions, arguments, lambda functions, recursion, scope, and docstrings.

## Data Structures

* **Lists**: Creating lists, list methods, and list comprehensions.
* **Tuples**: Creating tuples, tuple unpacking, and tuple methods.
* **Sets**: Creating sets, set methods, and set operations.
* **Dictionaries**: Creating dictionaries, dictionary methods, and dictionary comprehensions.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

* **Classes and Objects**: Defining classes and creating objects.
* **Constructors**: Using the `__init__` method.
* **Instance vs. Class Attributes**: Differentiating between instance and class attributes.
* **Inheritance**: Implementing inheritance and the `super()` function.
* **Operator Overloading**: Overloading operators for custom classes.

## Advanced Concepts

* **Decorators**: Using decorators with and without arguments.
* **Getters and Setters**: Implementing getters and setters using properties.
* **Instance, Static, and Class Methods**: Understanding the different types of methods in a class.
* **Dunder Methods**: Using "magic" or "dunder" methods like `__str__`, `__repr__`, and `__len__`.
* **Error Handling**: Using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` for error handling.
* **Map, Filter, and Reduce**: Using higher-order functions for functional programming.
* **`*args` and `**kwargs`**: Using variable-length arguments in functions.
* **Walrus Operator**: Using the `:=` operator.

## File I/O

* Reading from and writing to files.
* Appending to files.
* Reading files line by line.
* Using the `with` statement for file handling.
* Working with the `os` and `shutil` modules.

## External Modules

* **Virtual Environments**: Setting up and using virtual environments.
* **`requests`**: Making HTTP requests.
* **Regular Expressions**: Using the `re` module for pattern matching.
* **`threading`**: Working with threads for concurrent execution.
* **`argparse`**: Parsing command-line arguments.

## Projects

* **AI Chatbot**: A simple AI chatbot using the OpenAI API.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ggauravky/python-learnings-.git](https://github.com/ggauravky/python-learnings-.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the desired directory**:
    ```bash
    cd python-learnings-/Complete\ 2025\ Python\ Bootcamp\ Learn\ Python\ from\ Scratch\ by\ Code\ With\ Harry/<topic_folder>
    ```
3.  **Run the Python files**:
    You will need Python 3 installed on your system.
    ```bash
    python <filename.py>
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies**:
    For some of the scripts, you may need to install external libraries. You can install them using pip and the provided `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
